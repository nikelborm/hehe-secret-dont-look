# Plan

## Phase 1 -- in progress

## Phase 2

1. create a simple RPC experiment with effect RPC library
2. make 2 files, one sending requests
3. the other is receiving
4. Document how different is the dudes RPC usage from the usual RPC usage and
   what could become the barrier

## Phase 3

1. create a very simple protobuf file
2. try to generate everything that can be generated by multiple libraries that
   were selected during my initial research of ecosystem
3. make analysis of the differences between the generated code

## Phase 4

1. reevaluate if anything significant have changed since my initial research of
   available options
