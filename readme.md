## TODO

1. benchmark which protobuf generate TS files are the smallest, shic
2. PR to ts-proto to enable tree-shaking?
3. PR to ts-proto to enable `erasableSyntaxOnly`?

## Notes

1. gogo/proto deprecated: [moby/buildkit#3119](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/3119)
2. protobuf.js is dead
3. there's nothing in Effect.ts codebase about protobuf or gRPC. Only MsgPack, which is irrelevant
4. [GitHub bufbuild/protobuf-es](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es), [@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es) are fresh and hot (3 yo)
5. 2 previous libraries are used by [GitHub stephenh/ts-proto](https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto), [NPM stephenh/ts-proto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-proto), which I use
