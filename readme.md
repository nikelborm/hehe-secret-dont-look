## Goodies, saves, inspiration and other random links

1. https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moby/buildkit/client/llb
2. https://github.com/dagger/dagger

## TODO

1. benchmark which protobuf generate TS files are the smallest, or faster working
2. PR to ts-proto to enable tree-shaking?
3. analyze other existing libraries for generating typescript from .proto, to choose a better basis.
4. research into [vtproto generation](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/5342#issuecomment-2362232396)?
5. write decorator to apply to all functions, that will save all its inputs and outputs into a global registry, for later inspection
6. attempt to generate a build from single inlined tree shaken script
7. GUI to inspect and create LLB of buildkit + registry for buildkit configurations
8. maybe take some code to generate ts types from schema and back stored in [Effect-TS/language-service](https://github.com/Effect-TS/language-service)
9. maybe add my implementation later to [grpc-ecosystem/awesome-grpc](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/awesome-grpc)
10. Research selling points of infrastructure as code
11. Write a letter to [this dude](https://mattrickard.com/request-for-project-typescript-docker-construct)?
12. maybe implement something like [this](https://typia.io/docs/protobuf/encode/) in the future?

## Selling points

1. JS -- top used language, TS - 5th most popular
2. Effect.ts -- pure functions for reproducability
3. Support for dynamic code parametrization instead of templating yamls with unreliable, untraceable `${}`
4. Better observability and tracing globally what teams need help with docker more than other and how build times change over time.
5. Dockerfile components reuse and shared parametrized configs.
6. Modules, packages, and inheritance for LLBs
7. Much better UX with much better autocomplete (in-IDE autocomplete for secrets names, or build args, provided by the type-system)
8. Show the world of buildkit for frontenders

## Notes

1. gogo/proto deprecated: [moby/buildkit#3119](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/3119)
2. protobuf.js is dead
3. there's nothing in Effect.ts codebase about protobuf or gRPC. Only MsgPack, which is irrelevant
4. important thing is to somehow be aware of every cacheable shit in existence, so that we can work with artifacts based on their cache. We need to store and calculate [hashes](https://mattrickard.com/vertical-workflow-engines).
5. Don't forget to disable telemetry if any would be present in projects.
6. Strictly follow rules of License of the project chosen as a basis.
7. Use @generated field from jsdoc

The version inside NPM is written in TS, however the maintainer was going to rewrite it to rust. This rust version is not finished. Won't be helpful because I don't know Rust. |

Plus it generates only `.d.ts` declarations instead of usual typescript, which makes it a bad candidate for a base of my project. Bad ES6 support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
